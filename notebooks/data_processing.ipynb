This formula assumes that there is a linear relationship between smoke impact and distance from Norman, and that a fire past 650 miles has zero impact, both of which we know are likely not completely true, but we belive can make for useful simplifications.\n",

Similar to above, this formula assumes that there is a linear relationship between smoke impact and fire acreage.\n",
